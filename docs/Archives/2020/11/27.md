   浏览器起初只是一个简单的远程文档查看器，后来被迫成为一个应用程序平台。由于浏览器一开始没设计为这个用途，后来互联网的诸多问题都是这个事实造成的。

   摘要: PHP 8.0 is a major update of the PHP language.
   It contains many new features and optimizations including named arguments, union types, attributes, constructor property promotion, match expression, nullsafe operator, JIT, and improvements in the type system, error handling, and consistency.

   PHP无论怎么更新，给我感觉还是一如既往的丑，设计得毫无章法。

   摘要：But open source success, Thornton quickly found, has a dark side. He felt inundated. Countless people wrote him and Otto every week with bug reports, demands for new features, questions, praise. Thornton would finish his day job and then spend four or five hours every night frantically working on Bootstrap—managing queries, writing new code. “I couldn't grab dinner with someone after work,” he says, because he felt like he'd be letting users down: *I shouldn't be out enjoying myself. I should be working on Bootstrap!*

   文章以 BootstrapUI 作者 Thornton 为例，描述了 在没有资本背书的情况下 开源工作者的现状，很残酷也很无奈。开源代表的就是一份责任，如果没有一个良好的反馈机制，很难走下去。
